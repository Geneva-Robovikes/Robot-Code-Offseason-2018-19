Autopath: A command that reads a CSV file generated by Motion_Profile_Generator (run Motion_Profile_Generator2.0.0.jar
located in the main project to create a path for the robot to follow). Input one of the CSV files generated by it (either
left or right, not the detailed ones tho). It should follow the path if you create the path correctly.
